    <h1>The PS3 - Bliss in 720p</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The PS3 is Sony's most infamous console. $600USD, bricking, bad third party support. In the start the PS3 wasn't selling well and overall wasn't exactly in a good place. In 2009, Sony completley 360'd their marketing method to compete better with the Xbox 360. They cut the price in half, made it matte black, and cut out the spider-man font. The PS3 ended up outselling the Xbox 360. How amazing really was the PS3?</p>
    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <p>The PS3 launched in 2006, a few months after the Xbox 360, with Call of Duty 3, Ridge Racer 7 and Rainbow Six: Vegas among others. Later in its lifespan it got a lot of well remembered games; Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Driver: San Francisco(also on 360), The CODMW games and arguably most famously, The Last of us in 2013, a few months before Sony's next console launched.</p>
