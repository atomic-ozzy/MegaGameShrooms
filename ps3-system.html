    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgrey">The PS3 is Sony's most infamous console. $600USD, bricking, bad third party support. In the start the PS3 wasn't selling as many units and Sony had hoped based on their other console sales and the system wasn't exactly in a good place. In 2009, Sony completley 360'd their marketing method to compete better with the Xbox 360. They cut the price in half, made it matte black, and cut out the spider-man font. The PS3 ended up outselling the Xbox 360. How amazing really was the PS3?</p>
    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgrey">The PS3 launched in 2006, a few months after the Xbox 360, with Call of Duty 3, Ridge Racer 7 and Rainbow Six: Vegas among others. Later in its lifespan it got a lot of well remembered games; Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, Driver: San Francisco(also on 360), The CODMW games and arguably most famously, The Last of us in 2013, a few months before Sony's next console launched.</p>
    <h2>CMOS Battery Issue</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgrey">In every device there is a CMOS battery, otherwise known as the clock. When this inevitably stops functioning, it is quite easy and cheap to replace. The problem here is that with both the PS3 and PS4 systems, when support ends, or the system is not connected to the internet, therfore not connected to sony's servers, the system will no longer be able to play ps3 games on disc or online even with replacing the battery.</p>
    <h2>End of Life</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgrey">PS3 support is technically ongoing and developer's can still make games for it. The last games were made in 2016 apart from the occasional sports game.
